House Fights

Has an aggressor and a defender.
Aggressor will either focus on insight or insult. The higher the gamebot score, the more likely it will be insight-based.
Applies to the defender as well, but they're more baseline likely to insult than insight.

3 Intensities: Mild, Argument, Shouting Match

It can end in 1 of 3 ways:
Denial (defender minimizes damage from insight/narrative changes)
Counter (defender replies with their own insight/insult to drown out the aggressor)
Exposure (defender does not engage, so insight/insult is shared but aggressor still looks bad)




Insight

Juiciness - A measure of how fresh the information is, which will determine how much trust is built,
as well as how much it affects decision-making.

What goes into juiciness?

1. How recent is the information (ex: how long ago (in days) was the alliance made)
2. How surprising is the information (based on what you know about all parties)
3. Was this information already known
4. Do you actually believe it
5. How long ago did you find out (very fresh information is very potent; 3/4 life every cycle)
